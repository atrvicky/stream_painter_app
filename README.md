# base_app

App built to paint points on canvas using CustomPainter. 
The coordinates for these dots are streamed in using a private websocket and handled with StreamBuilder()

The ideas is that the dots should disappear after the new stream value comes in and draws new dots. As to create moving dots.

Everything is in main.dart
